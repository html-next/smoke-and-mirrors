## vertical-collection

We're rebuilding!

And while we're rebuilding, we've trimmed down to just the `vertical-collection`. Currently we re-export
  this component from our sibling-package [`@html-next/vertical-collection`](https://github.com/html-next/vertical-collection).

If you are only using the `vertical-collection`, you should use that package directly instead.

## Documentation

While we re-imagine smoke-and-mirrors, the docs for `vertical-collection` are [available here](http://html-next.github.io/vertical-collection/).

 PRs are always welcome and loved! It's usually a good idea to open an issue
 and chat with one of the maintainers beforehand. We hang out in the [`#dev-html-next`](https://embercommunity.slack.com/messages/dev-html-next/)
 channel on the Ember Community Slack.
